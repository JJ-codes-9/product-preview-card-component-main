## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- I found more practical ways to center using flex elements.


### Continued development

- I had hard time understanding the media queries and how to write the code for the mobile view so I need to focus on that on the future challenges. 

### Useful resources

MDN and StackOverflow
